# React Clicky Game

## About This Project

React Clicky Game is a memory game built with React.js.

When a user loads the webpage, they are presented with 12 images, which are assorted randomly. Each time they click an image, the images reshuffle and they can pick again. The goal of the game is to only click each image one time. When they succeed, they get a point. When they fail, the game starts over and their high score is tracked. 

You can play the game [here](https://k8f.github.io/clicky-game/).

## Technologies

* React.js - UI
* Bootstrap - CSS framework

There are 2 main components in the app: 
1. Cards.js, which holds the images.
2. GameContainer.js, which contains the functioning code for the game and the remaining JSX. 

Additionally, there is a Jumbotron component, which holds the content for a Bootstrap jumbotron.
